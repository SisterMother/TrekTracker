# Project Title

Welcome to Trek Tracker! Here you can search for trails near you, upload photos, and see others! Pictures can be viewed in lists which are either associated with a user or trail. Any picture can be viewed, but to submit a new photo, you need to login with a Google account. 

## Getting Started

* Initially, npm install in the root of the repo. 
Steps: 
* I. initialize the database: 
  * -make sure mysql and mysql2 is install locally
  * -run `mysql.server start`
  * -run `mysql -u student`
    * -If there is no student profile, create one with the password 'student', otherwise the database/config.json development object can be changed to a username and password currently existing. For the default mysql profile, change username to 'root', and password to an empty string. 
  * -create a database for this app by running the following command in the mysql shell opened from the previous step: `CREATE DATABASE TrekTracker`
  * -the tables and are automatically built with the correct columns if they do not already exist
  * -Database good to go! 
* II. Transpile the code: 
  * -in a new terminal tab, run `npm run react-dev`
* III. Start the server
  * -in a new terminal tab, run `npm run server-dev`
* IV. Open in browser
  * -open a new web browser window and navigate to `localhost:3000`
